## Tags used

The order you type tags is the order they appear in the page. Put more
general tags before more specific ones. 

* haskell
* reading-guide
* homework
* quiz
* daily-notes: Does this need to be a tag? Is it helpful? If so, should apply to everythin in the daily directory.


## Header fields

* shortsummary: Only used when no index is present. (Should override
automatically generated summary, ideally.)

## Chapters

We use the chapter number as the weight. Chapter titles should begin
with the chapter number. 

## Sections

A section to me is any item contained inside a specific chapter. 

|Weight|Purpose|
|------|---------------------------------|
| 10   | reading guide                   |
| 20   | problem set and/or solutions    |
| 30   | ?                               |
| 40   | summary                         |
