In class we discussed how to make the blue square and the triangle
above it. We decided to make the sides of the blue square 50 each, and
we discussed the side lengths and angles for every side.

    import math
    oneside = 50 * math.sqrt(2) 

## Tips

* Know the dimensions and angles for each shape before you start.
* Figure out the moves you want to do step by step. 
* Write the commands for each side before going to the next.
* One turtle per shape/color.
* Walking to the correct starting place can be easier than using
  `goto`.

## Assignments

* Use several turtles to make the square tangram design below.
