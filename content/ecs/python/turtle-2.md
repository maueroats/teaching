In class we discussed how to make the blue square and the triangle
above it. We decided to make the sides of the blue square 50 each, and
we discussed the side lengths and angles for every side.

	import math
	oneside = 50 * math.sqrt(2) 

* Use several turtles to make the square tangram design below.
