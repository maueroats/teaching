1. Make the picture below with three turtles. Use the same size shapes
   as you used in the other tangrams.

     {{% figure src="tangram-3.png" %}}
   
   
2. _Simple MadLib_.

        number: 3
        cost each: 2.95
        plural noun: tomato plants
        If I have 3 tomato plants and clone them all, then I have 6, costing $17.70 total.

    Of course make it so that you can type different numbers and nouns.
