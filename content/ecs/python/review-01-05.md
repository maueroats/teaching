---

1. The key next to the return key has both a single and double quote
   on it. Write a single print statement to show both characters on
   that key.
   
       {{% figure src="keys.png" title="Part of a keyboard" %}}
   
2. Line maker: input an integer m. Fill in the value of m in the print
   statement below.

    * Print: y = m * x 
    * Print the answer to the question: when x = 8, what is y?
    
    Example: person types "3", then the program prints out:
    
            y = 3 * x
            24
            
3. Ask a person's name. Store it in a variable. Print out: 
   _[name]'s puppy said, "Woof!"_ Example:

        What is your name? Mario
        Mario's puppy said, "Woof!"


4. Short multiplication table: Ask for the value of `y`. Print out the
   numbers 1*y, 2*y, 3*y, and 4*y.
   
         What is y? 5
         5 10 15 20

5. Ask for a noun and a verb. Print out "The [noun] [verb]ed."

         noun? apple
         verb? cook
         The apple cooked.


## Review Info

Ways to fill in a blank:

1. `print("I am {}.".format(name))`
2. `print("You are",name)`
3. `print("I do not "+verb+" anymore.")`
3. `print("He is "+str(age)+" years old.")`

Write an advantage or disadvantage of each.
