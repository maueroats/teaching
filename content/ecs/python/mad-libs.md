[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a game where you
ask for generic terms like "noun", "adjective", or "number", and then
fill in a (usually well known) story with those words. We are going to
make one today.


Minimum requirements:

* Four sentences.
* Eight substitutions.
* Two different instances of doing math to insert in your story. (

The math should be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division. Python should be doing the math; do not just ask the person
to do it. 

Example:

    noun? house
    number? 7
    past tense verb? ran
    
    I had 7 houses but one ran away, so now I have 6.


## Programming 

I suggest using [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3) to
write your project. You can use
[CodeAvengers](https://codeavengers.com) if you prefer, but the
error messages when you have problems are not as good.
