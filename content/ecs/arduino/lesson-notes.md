## Lesson 1: Introduction to parts

* What is an Arduino? 
* What can I do with an Arduino that I can't do with an ordinary
  (desktop|laptop) computer?
* Show the parts in the kits, say what they do.
* Demonstrate "cutaway" breadboard.
* Worksheet on the parts? It would be good to have.

## Lesson 2: Electricity

## Lesson 3: Making a circuit

Goal of lesson:

* I can correctly connect an LED and make it light up.
* I know how electricity flows through the components.


## Thoughts

Would it be useful to have a multimeter so students can see how their
circuits are connected?
