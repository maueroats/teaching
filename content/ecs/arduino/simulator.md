* Change back to "Components - Basic". Search for "potentiometer" if
  you can't see it.

## Tips

* The positive leg of the LED is longer - so you see it as bent in the picture.
* Pay attention to how the holes in the breadboard connect!
* Grab the white space on the background to move the whole assembly at
  the same time.
* Rotate a component is the icon in the upper left, just below the
  TinkerCad logo.

## Example to Make

Here is an example with one light that repeats a cycle from off to dim
to bright every 1.2 seconds.
