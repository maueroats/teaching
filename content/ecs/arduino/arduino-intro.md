We use [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
compatible boards, programmed with [Snap4Arduino](https://snap4arduino.rocks).

The materials we used are based off of the [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) [Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14265)
[**Experiment
Guide**](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/all). SparkFun
has lots of [learning materials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/) if you
are interested.

## Setup

If you are not using a school computer, you will want to install the
same software that we have:

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download)
* [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks/#download)

If you are using a school computer that does not have Snap4Arduino,
you should install the "MS Windows portable (64 bits)" version.

## Day 1

* [How to use a
  breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard).
* [Install
  StandardFirmata](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Installing-Standard-Firmata/)
  on an Arduino board.
  
## Day 2: LED

Connect an LED to the
breadboard: [Instructions](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/all#project-1-light). 

To learn: 

* What is an LED? 
* Electrical symbols for resistor, LED.
* Testing your circuit: "5V -> LED -> Resistor -> GND".
* How to draw a circuit diagram for "Pin11 -> LED -> Resistor -> GND".
