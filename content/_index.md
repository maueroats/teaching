AP CS: 
[Class JavaMethods GitHub](https://github.com/2017-2018-wy-ap-cs/java-rotary-phone.git) -> [Chomp project directory](https://github.com/2017-2018-wy-ap-cs/java-rotary-phone/tree/master/ch12/Chomp) -> [CharMatrix class](https://github.com/2017-2018-wy-ap-cs/java-rotary-phone/blob/master/ch12/Chomp/CharMatrix.java).
The CharMatrix code can be copy-and-pasted into Repl.it or DrJava. Make sure you test your code as you go, so you know what the problems are. There is a [tester file](https://github.com/2017-2018-wy-ap-cs/java-rotary-phone/blob/master/ch12/Chomp/CharMatrixTester.java) in the Chomp project directory that works with DrJava.

Intermediate CS: [Chapter 21 Worksheet A]({{% relref "21-ws-a.md" %}}) and [Worksheet B]({{% relref "21-ws-b.md" %}}). Make sure to test your code in DrRacket!
