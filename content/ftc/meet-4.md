(Door #4).  The parking lot off of Foster will *not* be available --- if
you park in this lot you will be towed.

## General Info 

Concessions will be available on-site.  There will be a variety of
snacks available for purchase, and an option to order pizza for lunch.

Important reminders:

*    Please bring enough safety glasses for your team, and remember to always wear safety glasses in the competition area and in the pits!
*    Access to power will be somewhat limited.  Please bring a power strip, and please clearly label your team’s chargers, batteries, and power strip with your team number.
*    Please complete the Robot and Field Self-Inspection Checklists prior to the competition, and refer to the special inspection notes below.

## Special Inspection Notes

The Robot and Field Inspection team would also like to remind teams of
a few frequent issues (if you have questions or concerns about any of
these please reply to this email and I will be happy to clarify and/or
help).  Please complete the self-inspection checklist prior to the day
of the competition -- we will be running on a tight schedule and
unfortunately will not be able to significantly delay the start of
matches to accommodate unprepared teams.  If you need help getting
your robot ready in advance of the competition, please reply to this
email and we will arrange assistance for your team:

*    All robots, even those using Modern Robotics Core Power Modules, must have a separate, securely installed, easily accessible, and clearly labeled main power switch
*    Robots must be labeled with team numbers at least 2.5 in tall with stroke width at least 0.5 in (this is especially important at the qualifier, as there will be many more teams in a much larger room and teams will be scouting for their alliance partners).  The font “Impact” size about 375 works well for this.
*    Motorola Moto G Play phones (the phones sold this year and last by the FTC storefront) must be updated to at least Android version 6.0.1.  Operating system requirements for other phones vary.
*    The Robot Controller and Drivers Station apps both must be updated to at least version 3.3, and both must be the same version.  If possible, we recommend updating to the latest version (3.6) or at least 3.5, since stability of the app has improved through the season.
