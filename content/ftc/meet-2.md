## Parking, Load-in, and Building Access:

You may park in the school’s lot, which is located off of Hoyne Street to the South of the school.  From the parking lot, go up the ramp on the right side of the school, and enter through the doors on the left at the top of this ramp.  This side entrance will be available for one hour (8:00 - 9:00) at the start to load in, and one hour at the end (12:30 - 1:30) to load out.  For security reasons, these doors will be locked from 9:00 to 12:00.  If you need access during this time, please call or text me directly for assistance.  Guests visiting during the match will need to enter through the main entrance of the school on 47th Street.

## Special Note about Make-up Matches

A number of attending teams that played at the Arturo Velazquez Institute on November 4th did not have the opportunity to play all 5 matches, and will make up these cancelled matches at Back of the Yards.  For example, a team that played only 3 matches on 11-04 will play 7 matches on 12-09.  Teams that do not need make-up matches may be asked to play as proxies in some of these matches in addition to the 5 official matches they will play on 12-09.  Please plan to stay until or possibly after 1:00 p.m. to accommodate this extended play, and thank you in advance for your gracious professionalism and flexibility as we work to provide fair opportunities to play to all teams!

## Food Options

Concessions (cash only) will be available on-site at the match.  There are also a variety of local and fast food options nearby -- one local favorite is the Back of the Yards Coffeehouse, right across Hoyne Street from our front entrance.  

## Prior to the Event:

*    Team roster and consent forms: FIRST would prefer teams create a team roster through TIMS.  If parents cannot complete consent forms online, teams can bring release forms signed by parents. Please see this link for more info:  http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-team-member-consent-and-release-form

*    Late Arrival or Not Attending: If you run into unexpected difficulties arriving, please let me know by calling or texting me (Halllie) at (773) 896-6533.  If we do not hear from you by 9:15 am, we will have to assume you will not be able to make it and continue the event without your team.

*    Robot Self Inspection: In order to enable inspection run smoothly we HIGHLY encourage you to fill out the robot self-inspection and field self-inspection checklists. This will really benefit all teams as it will mean the event will run smoother

*    Please remember to pack a power cord and spare tools and parts! -- Remember, even if you do not need a part you might be able to help out another team :-)
