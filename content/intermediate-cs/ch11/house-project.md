description: "Design your own house (art) and cost calculator (math). Practice managing complexity and good function-writing style."
---

In this project you will design a house of your own. You will write functions to create the house and functions to determine how much it will cost. Your costs do not have to be realistic. 
  
## Timeline

We will spend two whole days working on this in class. I expect it
will take 2-4 additional hours outside of class, although this will
depends on your understanding and how ambitious of a house you create.

Check in points:

1. Paper sketch and function outline approved for house image. 
2. Style check of two completed functions. 
3. House functions completed. 
4. Paper outline of functions approved for costs.
5. Cost functions completed.

Work days:

1. Sketch house and check-in plan.
    - List three traits you can change.
    - List functions needed. 
    - Write two of the house functions. 
    - (Work on house at home. Do at least two functions.)
2. Decide costs, outline functions needed. Start writing cost functions.
   Complete cost functions at home.
3. We will need a third work day to finish up.

Due: Thursday after Thanksgiving (note: we will work on new material this week).

## House

Make decisions on each of these areas. I have listed possibilities but
you can choose other ideas as well. Be creative and have fun.

1. Shape of the roof: triangle, isosceles trapezoid, rectangle.
2. Height of roof: fixed height, fixed slope.
3. Base: probably a rectangle but could be an octagon, several triangles, or make your own shape.
4. Option: Stilts? In hurricaine-prone areas, houses are built on stilts twelve feet off the ground so that a typical storm surge does not touch the ground floor.
5. Door: maybe one rectangle or two rectangles; could be a sliding patio-door type.
6. Windows could vary in height and style.
    - fixed height or make them grow taller as the house gets taller.
    - windows of various sizes or styles (like add a smaller attic window)
    - rectangular, octagonal, curved on top
7. Color: the whole house could vary in color, or certain parts could be colored similarly, some parts could always be the same color (like white windows or a grey roof).

## Cost 

1. Window cost depends on the dimensions and possibly shape.
2. Door cost is probably always the same, but you could have multiple doors so they cost more. 
3. Base of the house cost should depend on the dimensions. 
4. (**Attention: subtle instructions!** ) 
Roof cost depends on the area of the roof. You are almost certainly drawing a front view, so you should make the cost of the roof depend on the length of the top side that represents the part where the shingles would go. 

    Example: let's say your roof costs $16/"foot". Suppose you have made a roof by putting two 3-4-5 right triangles together. The part that you are going to count as the actual roof (for cost purposes) is the top two sides (hypotenuses). Each hypotenuse is 5ft, giving you 10ft of roof, which is a cost of $160.
    
## Style and Checks

Your project must be written in the style of a high quality Racket program:

* Functions are small and do _only one job_.
* VARIABLES are used to give meaning to the raw numbers you use.
* Meaningful names for function parameters. (Use "ticket-price" not just "x".)
* Check-expects for all functions.
* Line breaks and indentation: close as many parentheses as you want,
  then move to the next line. Your code must not change when
  auto-indented.
  
## Creativity 

Feel free to be creative. Houses can have decoration (images and
colors). Shapes do not have to be limited to triangles and
rectangles - Racket has many shapes available!
