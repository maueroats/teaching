1. We discussed the following function using tools from Chapter 9:
```racket
(centr "panda") =>       "*****panda*****"
(centr "sinful") =>      "*****sinful****"
(centr "conspicuous") => "**conspicuous**"
```
Write a signature, purpose, and function for centr.

2. We discussed 11.6.1, the house:
    - identifying pieces of house
    - separate functions for each piece
    - how to create the roof
    
3. You should finish the house 11.6.1 for homework if you did not finish it in class.
