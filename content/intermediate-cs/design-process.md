## Function

The function design process that we use is:

1. Signature
2. Purpose
3. Examples (two)
4. Function - write it.<br>
     4A. Skeleton - not visible when finished.
5. Check-expect - examples provide correct answers.

## Animations

* See [Chapter 6 Animations]({{% ignore relref "intermediate-cs/part-i/ch06" %}}) for the design process as it applies to writing animations (big-bang).

* The [Animations Slides]({{% ignore relref "animation2.md" %}}) detail the issues when 
writing handlers.
