## Assignment 15.A

Read the first three sections of Chapter 15. Do Exercises 15.3.{1,2,4,5,6}. 

Advice:

* 15.3.4: The first input is the candidate for whom you are counting votes. (For example "Clinton".) The next four inputs are votes cast for a person. (For example "Trump" "Clinton" "Sanders" "Trump".) You are supposed to return the number of votes for the candidate from the first input. (For example: `1` in this case.)

* 15.3.7: Keep using `build-image` not `build3-image`. 

Advanced students can do the image making functions 15.3.{3,7-11}.

## Assignment 15.B

Exercises 15.5.{1,2,3,4,5}

## Assignment 15.C

Read 15.6 ("Unnecessary conditionals").

Do Exercises 15.8.{2,3,5}. Exercise 15.5.6.

## Advanced

See the [build-image](build-image) tutorial. Use that to do 15.3.3 and 
15.3.{7-11}. Do not use `build3-image` even though the book says to use it. The `build-image` function is better.
