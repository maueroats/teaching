Exercises:

1. `hypotenuse`: Given two legs of a right triangle, return the length of the third side. 

2. `slope`: Given the x and y coordinates of two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) - in that order - return the slope of the line between those points. (OK if it does not work for vertical lines.)

3. `distance`: Given the x and y coordinates of two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), find the distance between them.

4. `quadratic-1`: Given a, b, and c, find one solution to a x^2+b x + c = 0.

5. `quadratic-2`: Given a, b, and c, find the other solution to a x^2+b x + c = 0.

6. Make an animation with a number model.
