1. Write a function `at-most-250` that takes in a number and puts out the same number, or 250 if the number is larger than 250.

2. Write a function `small-0` that takes in two numbers and gives out the distance to zero of the number that is closest to zero on the number line. It should work with negative numbers as well.

3. `random-3`: Write a function that gives a random number between -50 and 50.

4. `random-4`: Write a function that gives a random even number 0-200.

5. `dice`: Write a function that gives the total from randomly rolling two six sided dice.

5. `rstar`:
Write a function that makes a star with a random number of sides (5 to 10). 

6. `dstar`:
Write a function that makes two stars next to each other, one should have 4-8 sides and the other should have twice as many sides.
