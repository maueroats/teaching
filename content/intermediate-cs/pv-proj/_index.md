This project must incorporate position and velocity in some way. 

* At least two moving items. 
* Interaction of some kind between the items.

## Theme

* Period 1: Avocado.
* Period 5: French fries.
* Period 7: Rice / pasta.

## Plan

You need:

* two separate sketches of game ideas.
* pick one and draw two scenes from the game
* **model**
* paragraph description of the action

Do not miss anything in the model! It's hard to add more in later.

## Draw Handler

The next step is to make a draw handler that draws all of the scenes
that you have drawn in your plan.
