## Theme

* Period 1: Avocado.
* Period 5: French fries.
* Period 7: Rice / pasta.

## Plan

You need:

* two separate sketches of game ideas.
* pick one and draw two scenes from the game
* **model**
* paragraph description of the action

Do not miss anything in the model! It's hard to add more in later.

## Draw Handler

The next step is to make a draw handler that draws all of the scenes
that you have drawn in your plan.

## Motion

Make sure you have two things that move (or approval to skip this). It is likely to take two days to get the motion you want. Write checks as you go.

## Style 

* Check-expects for every function
* Follow the [style guidelines](http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-style) that we have discussed in class.

     + Close as many parentheses as you want on one line
     + Break after every group of closed parentheses
     
## Grading

* 25% style 
* 25% check-expect
* 50% content
