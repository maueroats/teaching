1. `sum-cubes`: number(n) -> number. Finds the sum of the first `n` perfect cubes. 

2. `vblock`: number(n) image(img) -> image. Makes a vertical stack of `n` copies of `img`.

3. `hblock`: number(n) image(img) -> image. Make a horizontal stack of `n` copies of `img`.

4. `grid`: number(rows) number(columns) image -> image. Make a grid that is `columns` wide and `rows` tall of the image repeated.

5. `add-sqrt`: number(start) number(end) -> number. Add up `(sqrt n)` beginning with `n=start` and stopping at `n=end-1`.

6. `lots-of-hyphens`: string(word) -> string. Insert a hyphen after every letter in the word. 

        (lots-of-hyphens "grape") ==> "g-r-a-p-e-"

Extra: get `"g-r-a-p-e"` instead.
