Intermediate Computer Science uses the [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org) environment and the [Picturing Programs](http://PicturingPrograms.com) textbook. Use [WeScheme](http://wescheme.org) if you cannot install programs, but read the [notes on WeScheme]({{< ref "/resources/ICS-WeScheme-Note.md">}}) because it is different in some ways.

## Foundations (Chapters 1--5)
