Intermediate Computer Science uses the
[DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org) environment and the [Picturing
Programs](http://PicturingPrograms.com) textbook. Use
[WeScheme](https://www.wescheme.org) if you cannot install programs, but
read the [notes on WeScheme]({{< ref
"/resources/ICS-WeScheme-Note.md">}}) because it is different in some
ways.

Eventually you will want to understand [why we learn
Racket]({{< relref "why-racket.md" >}}) instead of a more popular
language like Python.
