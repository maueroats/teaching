1. Make a 300x700 gradient that goes from "MediumVioletRed" at the top
   to "LimeGreen" at the bottom. Include at least three check-expects.
   
2. Create a function `purple-ize: image -> image` that takes in an
   image and changes every pixel's color to the closest "purple"
   color. 
   
       Say purple is red and blue, so the nearest purple color
       corresponds to whichever component has more.

       Example: the nearest purple color to (220,50,80) is
       (220,50,220), and the nearest purple color to (30,40,50) is
       (50,40,50).

Bonus: Animate a purple-izing circle of radius 20 that follows the
mouse around an image.
