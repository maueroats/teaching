1. Make a 300x700 gradient that goes from "MediumVioletRed" at the top
   to "LimeGreen" at the bottom. Include at least three check-expects.
   
2. Create a function `purple-ize: image -> image` that takes in an
   image and changes every pixel's color to the closest "purple"
   color. 
   
       Say purple is red and blue, so the nearest purple color uses as
       much red and blue as are available, and cuts off whichever color is
       more than that.

       Example: the nearest purple color to (220,50,80) is (80,50,80).
