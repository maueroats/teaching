description: "The drifter animation that takes little or big steps while moving."
---


## Drifter

**Drifter**. A circle moves around inside a rectangle. There are
   two different modes of motion: small steps (activated by "s") and
   big steps (activated by "b"). The arrows let you move the circle.
   
Example: `s left left` moves two small steps left, then `b up right
up` takes three big steps (up, right, and up in that order).
  
## Extras: Lite Review Questions

1. Take a posn and a color. Give a new color that has:

    * green = same as the original color
    * red = original red plus x value of posn
    * blue = original blue minus y value of posn
    
2. Math-er: takes in three numbers `code`, `a`, and `b`, puts out one number:

    * when code is 1, put out the sum of a and b
    * when code is 2, put out the positive difference between a and b
    * when code is any other number multiply a and b for the answer
