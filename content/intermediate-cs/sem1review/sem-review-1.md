1. **Random shape**. Write a function that returns a square, circle, or triangle. All should be equally likely.
```text
random-shape: ignore -> image
```

2. **Drift**. A smiley face starts at some position on the screen. It randomly drifts 5 pixels in some direction (up, down, left, or right) every 0.2 seconds. Write the function that gives its new position.
```text
drift-to-new: posn(old) -> posn(new)
```

3. **Reduce green**. Write a function `less-green` that reduces the amount of green in a color by 25%.
```text
less-green: color -> color
```
