The model is a time we will call $t$. The time will be between $0$ and $6\pi$.

The people coordinates are given by:

      (define (x-blue t) (* 200 (cos t))
      (define (y-red  t) (* 150 (sin t))


## Yellow Box

Make a 400x50 graph of the y-coordinate on the vertical axis. On the
horizontal axis is t. Make the background yellow and put a single
horizontal axis along the middle.

* Computer coordinates are $0 \le x \le 400$ and $0 \le y \le 50$.
* People coordinates are horizontally $0\le t \le 6\pi$ and vertically
  $-200 \le
  y \le 200$.
   
On the same graph, draw the x-coordinate vertically.
