1. Animation following the graph of an equation:
     - Computer coordinates
     - People coordinates

2. Repetition using `remainder`.

3. Max/min to keep values large/small.

4. Randomness
     - Range of random numbers (e.g., 10<=x<=50).
     - Write and test a non-random function first.

5. Write checks for a function that you do not yet know how to write.


Terms: 

- Computer coordinates: (0,0) in the upper left, positive y going down.
- People coordinates: (0,0) in the center, positive y going up.

## Review Problems

1. Make a sunset: a half circle that shrinks in radius and changes color from red(ish) to black as the sun sets. (Advanced: yellow to black.)
