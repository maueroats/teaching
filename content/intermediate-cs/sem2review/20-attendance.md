World 1 is the teacher counting students in a class. Other worlds are
students. The teacher yells "attendance" and then each student
responds "present". Hitting a key in the teacher's window triggers the
attendance-taking process. The teacher's window should show how many
students are present.

Write down your **model**, **message(s)**, and the **reaction** to
receiving each message in detail before programming.

## Common Misconceptions

* No special treatment is required if a student is absent. Absent corresponds to not having a window open.
* One keypress runs the whole procedure. It should not be necessary to hit a key in each 
window.
* Close one student window and take attendance again - make sure you get a different number.
