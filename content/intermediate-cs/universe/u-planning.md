## DRAFT 

1. **Multi-screen launcher**. This animation shoots a ball (circle) across two big-bangs. If you arrange the windows right, it will look like one long tennis volley (or something).


2. **Eenie-meenie-miney-moe**. A variation on the method children use
   to select who is "it" in a game of tag. Start with a number, which
   represents the number of steps left until "it" is selected. 
   
   Advanced: learn how to drop the selected world from the server and
   keep going until only one world is left.
