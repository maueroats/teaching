Every window has a different list of numbers at the start.
Show the sum of the list of numbers and the total, like this:

    20 = 8 + 7 + 5
    
When a person hits a number key from the top of the keyboard (`"1"`,`"2"`,...,`"9"`, `"0"`), that
number is added to the right hand side of the sum, and the correct new total is displayed.
For example, when the "4" key is hit, the display should show:

    24 = 8 + 7 + 5 + 4
    

## Advice

* Make sure the server is running. Correct code will do nothing without a server.

## Challenges

* Allow the entry of multi-digit numbers which are then sent by hitting space.
