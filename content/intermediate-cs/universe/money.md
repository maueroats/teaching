Idea: each player can throw money onto the table.

* Every player sees how much money is on the table.
* Hit any key to add $5 to the table.

Go into any window and hit a key. Every window's number should change.

* Next step: if you hit the "g" key in a window, it "greedily"
  increases its own number by 5, but not the number in every other
  window.
