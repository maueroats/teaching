These short projects (1-2 days) will help you get used to writing
code using the Universe.

1. [Color]({{% relref "u-color" %}}): set everyone's color to yours.
2. Count: add your own number to the total, display your number in a small box and the total big on the screen.

    {{% figure src="count-drawn.png" %}}

3. Color Strip. Modify the color program from above so that the model is a list of colors and hitting a key adds your color to the start of the list. Draw either the whole list of colors or the first 10.

    {{% figure src="color-list-drawn.png" %}}
