1. Make an animation with a shape that turns 15 degrees and grows by
   20% every second. (Possibly adjust to 5 degrees and 2% every 0.3
   sec once it works and you want it to look good.)
   
2. Make an animation where a shape starts in the upper left corner of
   an outlines rectangle and moves to a position 5 pixels right and
   two pixels down every 0.1 second.
