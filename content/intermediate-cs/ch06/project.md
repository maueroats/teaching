**Deadline**: Finish before Monday, October 23. Turn in Tuesday, October 24.

**Produce**: One sequence of big-bang animations per group. (Groups of at most two.)

**Goal**: Animation projects should demonstrate the use of draw, tick, mouse, and key handlers. 

**Time**: Spend approximately two hours on this project. 

Making an animation is a way to study for Monday's animation
test. Think of your work as a way to study and become more familiar
with animations.

# Ideas

* House of Mirrors
* Illusions
* Jump Scare (one big-bang ends and another starts)

# Requirements

* Every type of handler is used
* A draw handler shows multiple views of a model (more than one image of model on the screen). 


# Details

You should consider these inspirations:

* Drawing: placing a moving object behind another object.

* Motion: rotate, move by adding (above), move by subtracting (crop)

* Placing more than one moving image on a screen.
