# All Steps

1. Model
2. Draw handler
3. Tick handler
4. Key handler?
5. Mouse handler?

---

# 1. Decide model

* What will the computer remember in order to draw a scene? 

    - the moving parts 

    - image or number (usually)

* Write down type of model: image, number, string.

* Make an example (used in later testing).

--- 

# 2. Draw handler

* How will you draw the model on the screen?

    - non-moving parts go here
    
    - place image in appropriate spots

* Write and test this function!

---

# 3. Tick handler

* How will the model change from second to second?

    - in comes old model
    - out goes new model
    
* Write function and test a single step first!
