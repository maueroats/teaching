1. An arrow flies across the screen and stops with the head of the
   arrow buried in the target (but the fletching still visible).
   
   
2. (Fan.) A fan with three blades is in the off position. When you
   hit a key, all of the blades get larger. Making the blades "move" is
   an optical illusion that probably takes too much effort, but if you
   want try it with the mouse motion.
