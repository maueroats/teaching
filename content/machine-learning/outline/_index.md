There are a lot of pieces of knowledge that we need to fit together.

## Statistics

* Expected value (mean), variance, covariance. Algebraic properties.
* Standard deviation.
* Random variables. Distributions (probability density
  function). 
* Standard normal distribution ("Gaussian") with $\mu = 0$ and
  $\sigma = 1$.
* Scaling to get mean = 0, variance = 1.
* Area under normal distribution.
* Computations.

## Linear algebra

* Shapes. Transpose. Inverse. Determinant?
* Matrix-vector product.
* Dot product. Projection onto a vector.
* Solving linear systems.
* Derivative of matrix function like (X.w)^2 ?

## Regression

* **Not sure.**
* Do it and see that the method works.
