## Notes of Interest

I was just curious about the logistic distribution, so I dug up a few
points of interest. These are not critical. Especially do not confuse
this with other uses of logistic that come up later in the course.

1. From Wikipedia, the [logistic distribution is used to calculate
   chess ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sech-square_distribution#Chess_ratings):

     > Î¤he United States Chess Federation and FIDE have switched its formula for calculating chess ratings from the normal distribution to the logistic distribution; see the article on Elo rating system (itself based on the normal distribution). 

2. The logistic distribution is easier to work with than the normal
   distribution. There is a formula for its cumulative density
   function that does not require approximation on a computer.


## Graphical Summary of Linear Model
Download the `linearmodelplot.py` file from the attachments at the
bottom of the page.

Make sure you have the standard includes for Chapter 3. A quick
starter code is below. See the [full sample making a summary plot for
a linear model]({{% relref "Using plot_lm_summary" %}}) for a working notebook.

How to [upload python files to
Collaboratory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48905127/importing-py-files-in-google-colab).

```python
from linearmodelplot import plot_lm_summary
fitted_lm = sm.ols(...).fit()
plot_lm_summary(fitted_lm);
```

{{% notice tip %}}
Download the `linearmodelplot.py` and then use the 
[starter notebook including file-uploading
code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LhNP4uEkqAlzYByjGh3FPYt7iP-pnyOo)
to get going more easily.
