I was just curious about the logistic distribution, so I dug up a few
points of interest. These are not critical. Especially do not confuse
this with other uses of logistic that come up later in the course.

1. From Wikipedia, the [logistic distribution is used to calculate
   chess ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sech-square_distribution#Chess_ratings):

     > Î¤he United States Chess Federation and FIDE have switched its formula for calculating chess ratings from the normal distribution to the logistic distribution; see the article on Elo rating system (itself based on the normal distribution). 

2. The logistic distribution is easier to work with than the normal
   distribution. There is a formula for its cumulative density
   function that does not require approximation on a computer.
