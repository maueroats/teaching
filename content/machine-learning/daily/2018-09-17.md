This is a translation of ISL, Section 2.3 into Python with SciPy (and
NumPy and Pandas).

* A sequence of data points is probably an array:
  `vals = np.array([1,3,2,5])`.
  
* `len(vals)`

*  The first six whole numbers: `nums = np.arange(6)`

* A matrix is also an array: `np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])`. The list data
  is given in row-major order.
