$\DeclareMathOperator{\Var}{Var}$

1. Given the probability table below for the random variable W.

   1. Find the expected value of W.
   2. Find the variance of W.
   
| Prob | W |
|------|---|
| 1/3  | 6 | 
| 1/2  | 12|
| 1/6  | 24|


2. Prove that the variance is not linear by adding to your example
   above. That is, $\Var(3 W) \not= 3 \Var(W)$.
   
3. Guess a formula for $\Var (m W)$.
