Enhanced probability.

* (Definition of $Y|X$.) The random variable $Y|X$ (read: $Y$ given $X$) is a function of 
   $x$ and $y$. Given an $x$, the value is $y$ with probability $P(Y=y
   | X=x)$. 

* $E[Y|X]$, sometimes written $E_y[Y|X]$ is a function of x, giving
  expected value of y when you know $X=x$. That is, $$E_y[Y|X] = \sum_y
  P(Y=y | X=x)\cdot y .$$

* Law of Total Expectation. Using the definitions, try to prove that 
$$ E[Y] = E_x [ E_y [ Y|X] ]. $$
The left hand side could be written $E_y$ as well, if that is not
confusing. Some books write this without any subscripts, which I find
hard to read.
