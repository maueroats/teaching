## Choose a platform

* [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/): 
  Similar to a full-featured Jupyter notebook. 
* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com):
  Full-featured Jupyter notebook.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your own
  computer. Run `jupyter notebook` to start.

## Update software if needed

* Collaboratory: `! pip install seaborn==0.9.0`
* Azure: `! conda update seaborn -y`

Use `> /dev/null` to make output not visible after it works.
