It is hard to keep our room organized and clean. A few supplies would help a lot.

* Kleenex (lots)
* Paper towel (a few)
* Ziploc bags: gallon, quart (a few)
* Larger containers (lots, clean)
    - Lao Szechuan takeout containers: great
	- Large yogurt: good
	- Cottage cheese 

I use the takeout containers to organize materials for robotics classes and club.

## Specific donations

* Very old computer: to take apart for AP CS
* Old PC with parallel port
