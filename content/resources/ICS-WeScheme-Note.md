# Special notes for WeScheme users

You can use [WeScheme](http://wescheme.org) if you cannot install [DrRacket](http://racket
-lang.org). For example, if you have a Chromebook for your home computer. There are a few differences:

* Omit the `(require picturing-programs)` line.
* Instead of copy and pasting in a picture, you need to copy the link for the image and use `bitmap/url` like this:
     `(bitmap/url "https://www.what-dog.net/Images/faces2/main004.jpg")`
