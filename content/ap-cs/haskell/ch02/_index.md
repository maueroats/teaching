summary: "Essentials of creating lists and functions to manipulate them."
---

In the _Starting Out_ chapter we learn how to make lists and tuples. 
We also learn the basic list manipulation commands.

* Create a list: `[5..13]` or `[5,10..100]` or `[ n^2 | n<-[1..100], even n]`
* Create a tuple: `(5,12)`
* Key to remember: head, tail, init, last, `:`, `++`
* Other list functions: maximum, minimum, sum, product, reverse
