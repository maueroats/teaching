I expect this project to take 4-6 hours to complete over the course of
a week. If you spend less than 3 hours on the project you should read
the advanced notes about the minimax algorithm and (partially?)
implement it.

Expected times and other notes:

* `draw_board`: 1.0 hour, including class time
* `is_legal_move`: 0.5 hour
* `is_won`: 1.5-2 hours, including 0.5-1.0 hours planning time.
Expect to use several helper functions.
* `winner`: less than 0.5 hour
* `make_move`: 1.0 hour, including class time. See [spoilers]({{% relref "spoilers.md" %}}) if needed.
