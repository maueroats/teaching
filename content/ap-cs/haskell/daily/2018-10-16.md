1. [notAlone](https://codingbat.com/prob/p169506). 

     ```haskell
     notAlone :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
     notAlone nums x = undefined
     ```

2. [Team Tic Tac Toe](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=831)

     * Write teamWins to determine if a given team wins a given three
       in a row.
     
         ```haskell
         teamWins :: String -> [Char] -> Bool
         teamWins row team = undefined
         ```
         
     * Write allThrees, which gets all of the three in a row segments 
     from a board.
     
          ```haskell
          allThrees :: [String] -> [String]
          allThrees board = undefined
          ```
     
     * Write allTeams, which produces a list of all possible teams.
     
           ```haskell
           allTeams :: [String]
           ```

     * Combine the previous functions to solve the problem.
