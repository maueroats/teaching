We worked on the [Cow
Signal](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=665)
problem. 

To make your writing simpler, you should use the signature below. The
very last step of printing out everything on its own line is not an
important part of the problem.

```haskell
cowSignal :: Int -> [String] -> [String]
```

Printing on multiple lines: use `\n` like this: 
```haskell
x = "This\nstring\nprints\non\nmany\nlines"
main = do putStrLn x
```

## Extra Practice

[Square
Pasture](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=663). There
are two rectangular pastures, each given by the coordinates of their
upper left and lower right points. The two pastures do not
overlap. Find the minimum area required for a single square pasture to
enclose the two rectangle pastures.

```haskell
sqPasture :: ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> Int
sqPasture ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) ((x3,y3),(x4,y4)) = undefined
```
