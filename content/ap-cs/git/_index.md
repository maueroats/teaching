Git is a system for keeping track of all of the versions of things you write, both old and new. 
The whole system is quite complex, so we will limit ourselves to a small portion of what it can do.

You will use it for several purposes: 

* Turning in your work
* Backing up your work
* Transferring work to and from home via the internet instead of using a flash drive
* Collaborating with a group
