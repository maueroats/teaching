  - To set the size of a world:
```any
    World.setSize(10,21);
    World.setVisible(true);
```

  - Grab the lower right corner of the display window and drag it UP and LEFT to fit everything on the screen.

  - I have updated the AP CS master repository with several extra commands:

      + `./one-time` to set a few defaults
      + `./update` to get my new changes
      + `./save` to do the three saving commands all in one
