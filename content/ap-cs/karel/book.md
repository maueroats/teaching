The book is [Karel J Robot](https://www.amazon.com/Karel-Robot-Introduction-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/0970579519): "A Gentle Introduction to the Art of
Object-Oriented Programming in Java", by Joseph Bergin, Mark Stehlik,
Jim Roberts, and Rich Pattis. We have the January 2008 printing, but
all versions are very similar. Happily, the book is available for under $10 used if you 
want one or want to donate one.
