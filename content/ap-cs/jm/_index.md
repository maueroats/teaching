We use [Java Methods, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Methods-Object-Oriented-Programming-Structures/dp/0982477570) by Litvin and Litvin. 
While a PDF of the whole book is not available, the author has made available many resources:

* [Home page for all textbook resources](http://www.skylit.com/javamethods2/index.html)
* [PowerPoint slides](http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/ppt/index.html) for each chapter. These are quite thorough.
* [Starter code](http://www.skylit.com/disks.html) for students.

Note that **we have the second edition**, which is from 2011 (now out of date). There are probably few changes.
