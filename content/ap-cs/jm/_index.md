While a PDF of the book is not available, the author has made available many resources:

* [PowerPoint slides](http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/ppt/index.html) for each chapter. These are quite thorough.
* [Starter code](http://www.skylit.com/disks.html) for students.

Note that **we have the second edition**, which is from 2011 (now out of date). There are probably few changes. The book is very cheap, used, if you want an extra copy.
