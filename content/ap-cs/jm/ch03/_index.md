* Install BlueJ. If you are on a school computer (no Administrator access), you should download the "Standalone zip" from the [BlueJ Downloads Page](https://www.bluej.org/versions.html). Otherwise the "MSI Installer" is the way to go.

* Get the AP CS GridWorld. The easiest download is the [Gridworld for BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/help/ap.html). There are some configurations you can change, see that page for details.

{{% notice note %}}
You must find the Preferences -> Libraries area and add the `gridworld.jar` file to the list of libraries or nothing will work! Preferences on Mac OS are `Command-,` in the BlueJ menu, while on Windows they are under the Tools menu.
