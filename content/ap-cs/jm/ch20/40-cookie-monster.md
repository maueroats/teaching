This is Exercise 12 from Java Methods Chapter 20.

Start at the upper left (0,0) of a grid of numbers. Find a path to the lower right corner (cols-1,rows-1) that has the greatest sum. You can only go right and down. Your path is not allowed to contain a square with the number -1.

Data: Read a file describing a 2D array. The first line of the file contains two integers rows and cols. What follows is ROWS lines of data with COLS numbers in each line.

Output: The maximum sum.

Advanced: Report the path taken (an ordered list of coordinates).

    3 4
    1  2  2  3  4
    5 -1  5  7  9
    9 -1  9 -1 -1
