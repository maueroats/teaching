**noTrees**. Return a version of the given array where every occurrence of the word "tree" has been removed. Shift everything else down and place "grass" at the end of the array.

Examples:

```
noTrees(["rock", "tree", "Grass", "rock"])
==> ["rock", "Grass", "rock", "grass"]

noTrees(["Tree", "bush", "plant", "house", "TREE"])
==> ["bush", "plant", "house", "grass", "grass"]
```

* You may make a new array or modify the existing one.
* Match "tree" in any combination of cases of the letters.
* Starter code: [noTrees](NoTrees.java).
