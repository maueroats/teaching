Briefly: Complete 3-5 problems from ProCom 4 on HackerRank.

## Expectations

Five "points" is an A. You should be working on problems of an
appropriate level of difficulty for you. (Don't do five easy problems
in one day and then say you are done.)

## Debrief

* List the programs that you have completed.
* For each one:

  - Did you have any difficulties? 
  - What were they?
  - What was the root cause of one of those difficulties?
  - Did you learn something? What?
  
## Problem-specific comments

* _A Hexing Situation_: You cannot use split() - test cases have extra
  whitespace in them (not every word is separated by a single space).
  
* _Rebuilding the Rebellion Part Two_: Many people forget to handle the "No Win" situation. Another common problem is to check the main diagonal twice instead of checking both diagonals once.
