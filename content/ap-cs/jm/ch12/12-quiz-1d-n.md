(`similarEnds`)
An array has similar N-ends if the front and back N numbers are either
in the same order or reversed order. 

Return the largest N value for which an array has the same N-ends. 

* N is a positive integer.
* Give -1 if the ends are not similar at all.

Examples:

1. `similarEnds([20,30,40,50,50,40,30,20])` => 4.
2. `similarEnds([10,20,30,20,10])` => `3`.
