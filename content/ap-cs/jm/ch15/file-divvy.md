Get a subset of [Divvy bike trip data](smalltrips.csv). Later you may want the [Divvy station data](stations.csv) as well.

1. Find the trip of longest duration.
2. Find the oldest female rider in this dataset.

## Tips

You do not have to store the data in an `ArrayList`, but if you want to do that, you should make a class `BikeInfo` that has all of the information contained on one line in the database. Making 12 separate ArrayLists is lots harder to work with.
