1. Count the number of lines in a file.
2. Count the number of words in a file.
3. Count the number of characters in a file.
4. Find the sum of all of the integers in a file.
5. Print out the file with line numbers in front of each line.
7. **Where's Waldo?** Create a file called "waldo.txt" that consists of 10000 lines of text. Each line should have 10 random integers from 0 to 9999. Except that there is a 0.1% chance that a given line will instead have all of the same integer. 
8. **Find Waldo** Read a file called "waldo.txt" and print out every integer that occurs 10 times on a line, just like you would make in the previous problem.
6. Implement the "tree" command.
