This is more scratch!

{{% scratch %}}
forever
   change x by (5)
{{% /scratch %}}

Notice the problems with rendering the `<touching [Cat]>` block in
markdown. It renders fine in HTML.

{{% scratch %}}
forever
   if <touching [Cat]> then
       switch costume to [brown bag v]
   end
{{% /scratch %}}
