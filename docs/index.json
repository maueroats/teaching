For example, if the board is just the flat 5x1 board [[0,0,0,0,0]], then this function should give a list of the two possible 4-in-a-rows: [[(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0)], [(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(4,0)]].\n Given a board and a single ordered pair, get the corresponding value from the board.\n Given a board and four ordered pairs, return True if all of the corrsponding values are the same.\n Do the preceding to a whole list of 4 pairs of coordinates.\n Given a board, return True if it is won.\n There are a few more steps but you are almost there!\n  "

Email amauer-oats@cps.edu. I am willing to call or text with you. Make sure your student put your phone number on the parent page of the student information form \u0026hellip; or email me.\nPhilosophy I aim to create an equitable challenge for everyone in my class. I want to provide everyone in the class meaningful work experiences at a manageable but challenging intellectual level. I may give the same credit for different actual assignments to accomplish this goal.\nThe student side of this equitable challenge is that I expect everyone to work on computer science 100% of the time in class. This applies even if someone is finished with the current assignment or has been absent for a week. I have a shelf full of books available for advanced or catch-up work.\nI expect everyone to take my suggestions for improving their work seriously. Computer science is an art as well as a science. Polish good habits, eradicate bad ones. Please admit if you cling to unproductive habits and work honestly to change them.\nGrading weights and scale    Percent Category     20 Final Exam/Project (Quarterly)   40 Tests and Quizzes (individual)   20 Projects   20 Participation    Some grade should be updated every week. Every grade category except final exam should be updated every three weeks. Edline will have all raw score information. Only scaled (\u0026ldquo;curved\u0026rdquo;) scores will be posted on the CPS Gradebook.\nWe use the standard Whitney Young grading scale (90+ A, 80+ B, 70+ C, 60+ D, below 60 F).\nClass participation will be four points per day. You must be present and engaged in the class activities for the entire class to earn all of the points.\nGrading and attendance You must be present in order to learn from the class.\n   Absences Consequence     5 Call and email parent.   10 One letter grade (-10 point) deduction to final grade.   15 Additional -5 point deduction to final percentage.   20 Additional -5 point deduction to final percentage.   25 Failure in class    Three tardies more than 5 min late count as one absence.\nAny absence with a note from a medical doctor does not count toward the total absences. (Please make sure I see a copy of the note!) All other absences count. Please discuss necessary accomodations for IEP/504 in the first two weeks of class if I am not aware of them.\nDifferentiation All assigned work is expected to be completed.\nThere is no extra credit without regular credit. The way to improve a grade is through consistent effort, seeking help when needed, and allocating enough effective work time outside of class. Please track your work in your interactive notebook so we can discuss how to make your time more effective.\nAdvanced students may be allowed to replace standard work with projects, but all exceptions will be accompanied by a written contract detailing what other work will be completed to replace the main line coursework. In at most two weeks, the project is due and will receive a grade. Students are still responsible for standard material.\nEssentials of involvement As much as we can, we let students manage their own learning. Occasionally parents should be involved more at home. Sometimes adults need to talk directly. Please contact me directly if you see (or are being told) that grades are not up to date or your student is exempt from the work for any reason and does not have written documentation.\nDaily Materials  Notebook: A thin spiral or composition notebook dedicated to computer science is required for planning, reflection, and documenting progress.\n USB Flash Drive: A small USB drive to store files. (Any size is fine. Code is small.)\n  IEP and 504 plans will be followed Any student with a 504 or IEP will receive all accomodations listed. Please make sure the teacher has received a copy of the plan at the start of the year (especially if your schedule has changed, sometimes the paperwork follows too slowly).\nState standards Computer Science Teachers Association standards applicable in this class:\n 4.2.1 Computational Thinking (CT) 4.2.2 Collaboration (CL) 4.2.3 Computing Practice and Programming (CPP) See individual unit plans for more details.

(Groups of at most two.)\nGoal: Art projects should demonstrate a range of functions from the chapter, try to use 3-4 from each category in your whole project.\n Methods of placement: beside, above, overlay, place-image, as well as the \u0026ldquo;/align\u0026rdquo; variations. (Use the variations!)\n Changing pictures: crop, scale, rotate.\n Shapes: triangles (many!), lots more listed at the end of Chapter 3 (PDF pages 60\u0026ndash;61).\n Colors: color-database, make-color from the internet, colorize or name-\u0026gt;color.\n  Remember: This is a short project. I expect you will spend no more than three hours on it, including time working in class Monday and Tuesday.\nIt is OK to simplify and focus on using the goal functions (see above).\nSteps  Find one inspiration piece of art. Have idea approved before the first class ends. Complete by working in class Friday and Monday, and possibly some time at home over the weekend.  Choice 1: DrRacket\u0026rsquo;s take on MoMA Choose a piece of art for inspiration.\n School appropriate. No duplicates with anyone you know in any class. MoMA archive:  Textiles from Japan - which could have floral patterns or numbers from the cataloging process Islamic art \u0026mdash; like this   Choice #2: Picture Puzzles Goal: create two pictures that are challenging or interesting to recreate once they are finished. If you can get someone to say, \u0026ldquo;How did you do that?\u0026ldquo;, your puzzle is a success.\nPossible sources:\n Geometry puzzles Triangle puzzles Mondrian  "

	"content": "The essentials of the Types and Typeclasses chapter are: writing type signatures for functions, reading string inputs with the Read class, and dealing with Integral to Fractional conversions when they are needed.  You can explicitly say what type a number is by using two colons and the type you want - for example, (5::Int) or (5::Float). Find the types of each of the operations below, or say in English why it does not work. Do not just copy error messages.\n (/) (5::Int) / (10::Int) (5::Int) / (10::Float) (5::Float) / (10::Float)   Write a function to find the average of numbers in a list. This should bring up the difficulty that you cannot divide an integer by an integer(!).\nExamples: avg [10,20] should give 15 or 15.0, and avg [3.5, 4.5] should give 4.0.\n Write a signature and function body for add10Word which reads an integer from a string and adds 10 to it.\nExample: add10Word \u0026quot;15\u0026quot; should produce 25.\n Write a signature and function body for numberInSentence, which takes a number and returns the sentence \u0026ldquo;I have ___ pounds of flour.\u0026rdquo;\nExample: numberInSentence 5.5 reports \u0026ldquo;I have 5.5 pounds of flour.\u0026rdquo;\n Write a signature and function body for doubleDebt which takes a String and puts out a Float. The String contains a floating point number that represents how much money someone owes, and the Float output is twice that much.\nExample: doubleDebt \u0026quot;50.10\u0026quot; produces 100.20.\n Write a signature and function body for sampleStdDev that finds the sample standard deviation of a list of (the right kind of) numbers. Check the type signature for square root (sqrt)!\nPlease do not skip this problem with the excuse that you do not know how to find standard deviation. Look it up or ask someone who knows!\n Possibly Challenging: Write the function median to find the median of a list of items that can be ordered. (Use the type Int, if you prefer.) Assume the list is sorted.\n  We will learn how to sort a list later, but it goes like this:\nimport Data.List result = sort xs"

	"description": "",
	"content": " Many people we encounter tell us they wish they knew how to code and then ask which programming language they should learn. Given the press that some programming languages get, this question is not surprising. But it is also wholly inappropriate. Learning to program in a currently fashionable programming language often sets up students for eventual failure. Fashion in this world is extremely short lived. A typical “quick programming in X” book or course fails to teach principles that transfer to the next fashion language. Worse, the language itself often distracts from the acquisition of transferable skills, at the level of both expressing solutions and dealing with programming mistakes.\n\u0026ndash; Felleison et al, How to Design Programs, Second Edition.\n To understand why Racket is a good language to learn, one need read no further than Section 0.1 of Stephen Bloch\u0026rsquo;s Picturing Programs. Please read it now if you have not.\nTo summarize, here are major arguments for choosing Racket over a more \u0026ldquo;popular\u0026rdquo; programming language:\n Racket\u0026rsquo;s uniform syntax (everything is in parentheses, no order of operations, means that everything you do learn is a real intellectual concept.\n Racket works without any incantations that cannot be understood by a beginner. Example: Java\u0026rsquo;s public static void main (String[] args) incantation.\n Racket\u0026rsquo;s language levels protects you from advanced features that could be misunderstood at the start, but lets you continue to program in the same familiar language with more advanced features when you are ready.\n Any language you choose will be obsolete by the time you enter the workforce in 4-8 years, so effort spent learning language-specific syntax is not productive. Instead, you need to learn how to learn a new language. Most programmers find themselves working in a variety of languages depending on the requirements of their current task.\n Paul Graham\u0026rsquo;s article Beating the Averages explains how they used Lisp to make a very successful business (it was worth almost $50 million when it was purchased by Yahoo!). Lisp is a language very similar to Racket.\n Racket includes a way to build web applications as well as a graphical user interface builder that works on any kind of computer.\n Nobody should pass judgement on Racket until they understand the macro system that it has! Consider that a challenge if you are an advanced student.\n  "

In Racket, grouping is done only by parentheses.\nIndenting to the same level \u0026ldquo;All grouped expressions must be exactly aligned.\u0026rdquo;\n Example 1a: good indentation\nif x `mod` 3 == 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; x `mod` 5 == 0 -- good. aligned with top x. ... Example 1a: bad indentation\nif x `mod` 3 == 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; x `mod` 5 == 0 -- wrong. not aligned with top x ... Indenting further \u0026ldquo;Code which is part of some expression [must] be indented further than the beginning of that expression.\n Not enough indentation On one hand, this means that if you do not indent, you are not continuing a preceding expression. Example 2:\nif x `mod` 3 == 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; x `mod` 5 == 0 then -- wrong; needs to be indented further than the if x else -- wrong again 0 Too much indentation On the other hand, if you do indent, you may be continuing something you wrote previously.\nHow could this be an issue? If you write one function and then indent a later function, Haskell thinks you want the second function to be inside the first function (as in, a \u0026ldquo;sub-function\u0026rdquo;).\nExample:\nmain = do putStrLn $ helper 5 -- all this space does not change anything... -- answer x = 200 * x helper x = answer x + 1 Notice how answer is indented more than main? That makes the answer function live inside of main\u0026hellip; this will cause all sorts of problems, but the first one is that helper cannot see answer because helper cannot see anything inside of another function like main.\nThe source for all quotes in this article is the Haskell article on indentation. Other example issues came from observations in class.\n"

This is equivalent to Racket \u0026ldquo;;\u0026rdquo; (semicolon).\n Function name rules:\n Must begin with lowercase letter. Hyphens (-) are not allowed in names. Underscore (_) may be used instead.\n Traditionally camelCase is used for functions. (First letter lowercase, then uppercase each new word.)\n  We will learn about the $ sign soon, but it is a substitute for putting parentheses from somewhere to the end of the line. That means\nputStrLn ( show ( grapher f 0 10 ) ) could be written as\nputStrLn $ show $ grapher f 0 10  "

	"content": "Writing a file is different from typing in an interpreter like repl.it or ghci. The differences include no let statements at the top level and no automatic printing of results.\nInterpreter vs file An interpreter is what the \u0026ldquo;interactions pane\u0026rdquo; is called. In DrRacket, the interactions pane is the one on the bottom. In repl.it, the interactions pane is on the right side. Interactions with an interpreter can not be saved. There is a command line interpeter in the Haskell Platform called ghci.\nA file is equivalent to the \u0026ldquo;definitions pane\u0026rdquo; in DrRacket. In repl.it, the left hand side of the window is a file. Files can be saved. You need to load (or \u0026ldquo;play\u0026rdquo;) a file to see the results.\nNo let statements needed to make variables or functions Writing a file is different than typing in an interpreter. The whole file is loaded and (usually) the main function is run. When defining functions and variables a file, the word let is not used and the results are not immediately printed. A file equivalent might be written:\nw = \u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34; wlen = length w main = do putStrLn (show wlen) Typing in an interpreter, every statement gives an immediate result, so the following is similar code for comparison:\nPrelude\u0026gt; let w = \u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34; Prelude\u0026gt; length w 3 Output to screen when running a file Loading or running a file will not automatically cause results to print.\nUse the putStrLn function to output a string.\n w = \u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34; main = do putStrLn w Printing items that are not strings requires the use of show to make the string that is printed.\nPrelude\u0026gt; let w = [\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;of\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;big words\u0026#34;] Prelude\u0026gt; putStrLn (show w) [\u0026#34;list\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;of\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;big words\u0026#34;] Omitting the show will produce an error message:\nPrelude\u0026gt; putStrLn w \u0026lt;interactive\u0026gt;:7:10: error: • Couldn\u0026#39;t match type ‘[Char]’ with ‘Char’ Expected type: String Actual type: [[Char]] • In the first argument of ‘putStrLn’, namely ‘w’ In the expression: putStrLn w In an equation for ‘it’: it = putStrLn w"
